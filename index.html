						Our team consist of 4 ambitious members. We created this team in
						2022 since then we tried our best to participate in various
						competitions and challenge ourself to hardwer and more complicated
						porjects. We all plan to go and study close to this subject and
						enviroment. Most of us is in our last year and soon will be brought
						to a decision of our future. We all plan to attend to universities
						and learn more and more. We are good friends with each other and we
						try to help out whenever we can. It is a mutual relationship between
						us team mebers. If one of us don't understand the concepts that one
						thought of we discuss it and move forward with the development.
						Development is a fun and exhousting activity but the process is what
						important the fails and rebuilding is what it makes it soo much fun
						too.

						<h2>Mester Máté</h2>
						<h4>Role: Hardware</h4>
						<p>
							Máté focuses on the mechanical aspect of our robot, he works on
							the design and assembly of the robot. He designs the main body,
							and he designed our latest 3D printed wheels. He also deals with
							the logistical issues for the team. This is his third year with
							the team. Mate took intrest in mechanical engineering. He's 18
							years old.

						<h2>Tran Duy Dat</h2>
						<h4>Role: Hardware</h4>
						<p>
							Dat also focuses on the mechanical aspect of the robot, he designs
							parts using CAD software and helps with the assembly of parts. He
							designed our custom support arm which enables the robot for
							climbing into high surfaces. He's 18 years old as well and he took
							intrest in mechanical engineering and web development. He's the
							one who developped the TDM as a website and designed the team
							shirt. He's also in his third year in this team.

						<h2>Vadász Bence</h2>
						<h4>Role: Hardware</h4>
						<p>
							Bence is the newest and youngest member of our team, he helps out
							with the hardware related aspects of our robot and the assembly.
							He's currently trying to understand the robot itself. He's also
							the one who designed our team's logo.

						<h2>Vadász Zsolt</h2>
						<h4>Role: Programmer</h4>
						<p>
							Zsolt is responsible for the software of the robot. He's the one
							who programmed the robot movement and arm functionality as well as
							the image recognition software. He's intrested in micro controller
							programming as well as the manufacturing process of these
							controllers. He's 19 years old.

					<h1>Competitions we attended so far</h1>
					<div class="comps-box">
						<h3>MIRK (Hungarian Youth Robo Cup) year 2024</h3>
						<img
							src="./img/firstPlace1.jpg"
							alt="Picture of the 2024 MIRK RMRC robot"
						/>
						<p>
							MIRK 2024: This was our third competition and our third win with
							this we are three times Hungarian champions. The biggest
							difference is our robot's build. Firstly we moved our motors
							inline with our electronics with this the height of the robot
							decreased and the wheight optimalised. We also switched the energy
							source instead of using 18650 litium batteries we used a Parkside
							20V drill battery however with the more voltage we needed two
							stepdowns instead of one. We also switched back to Motozero
							instead of the L298n motor driver which helped us with the inner
							space however the downside of the Motozero was the heat. We needed
							to install a fan and put on a heatsink to prevent the driver to
							overheat. We also used servo motors instead of stepper motors. We
							also realized that the 3D printed parts weren't durable so we
							found some metal cases and build a arm out of that. The controll
							of the arm was done with the PCA9868 arduino board. We also finxed
							the video latency and intalled a second camera for the back view
							with this we used two person to operate. One was driving the main
							robot and one was checking with him the camreras. We brought a
							secondary monitor to see the camera output better.

						<h3>Previous RoboCup23</h3>
						<img
							src="img/robocup23.jpg"
							alt="Picture of the robot in RoboCup23"
						/>
						<p>
							RoboÍCup23, Bordeaux France. The first international competition
							we participate was the RoboCup23 last year. The first thing we
							wanted to do was the arm. The mistake from MIRK(Hungarian Youth
							Robo Cup) was that we couldn't use our arm and it prevented us
							from getting critical points so that time we designed an arm which
							used 28-BYJ stepper motors. We also tried making a custom PCB that
							would provide us with powering all 8 stepper motors and also
							controlling them. Unfortunately both the PCB and stepper arm
							didn't work. We forgot a crucial part when designing the robot
							arm. How much wheight can the motors hold on a certian distance?
							Well in this case not a lot. When we gave 5V(This is the supported
							voltage of the motor) the arm couldn't lift itself up, but when we
							connected on the 12V it was enough to start moving and functioning
							however the energy consumption also skyrocked. On the motor part
							the socket for the motor was 3D printed, but the rough arena and
							the conditions were too much for the basic L shape motor holder.
							It broke in the middle of the competition. One of the bigger
							challenge was the camera streaming and the image recognition.
							Zsolti spent a great amount of time on debugging and developping.
							The software was written in C and there wasn't a library for the
							purpose we wanted. All in all the competition was really helpull
							and we learned a lot from it.

						<h3>MIRK (Hungarian Youth Robo Cup) year 2023</h3>
						<img
							src="./img/firstPlace2.jpg"
							alt="Picture of the 2023 MIRK RMRC robot"
						/>
						<p>
							The second MIRK was held in 2023 where we improved our motors and
							wheels. We used bigger wheels which helped us in the uneven parts
							of the arena. We also swhiched the robot arm that time we wanted
							to use a custom arm and we tried our best to make one with the
							separate parts we found in the workspace. Unfortunately the arm
							didn't work it couldn't lift itself up. We also got better motors
							which were half metal geared and half plastic geared which was a
							big improvment because it didn't break this time. After winning
							the championship our mentor Mr. Bakti András mentioned the
							RoboCup23 and asked us if we want to participate in it and we said
							yes and the preparations for the RoboCup begun.

						<h3>MIRK (Hungarian Youth Robo Cup) year 2022</h3>
						<img
							src="img/firstPlace3.jpg"
							alt="Picture of the 2022 MIRK RMRC robot"
						/>
						<p>
							Our first competition was in 2022 march. As you can see the robot
							was made out of 2 3mm plexi board which was cut with laser. The
							arm was controlled with a Raspberry Pi 4 connected to a PCA9868
							servo controller. We used 3 cells which provided 12V which we
							converted down to 5V to the Raspberry. The motors was controlled
							with a Motozero and the motors were running on 12V. unfortunately
							the motors broke in some parts of the arena and we couldn't reused
							them in the following year.
